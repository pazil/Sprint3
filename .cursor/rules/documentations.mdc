# Documentation Generation Policy

## CRITICAL RULE: Do NOT Generate Unnecessary Documentation

**NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md, README, etc.) unless EXPLICITLY requested by the user.**

### Rules:
1. **NO automatic documentation generation** - Do not create markdown files, README files, or any documentation as a "helpful" side effect of completing a task
2. **Only create docs when explicitly asked** - The user must specifically request documentation creation (e.g., "create a README", "document this API")
3. **Avoid redundant files** - Do not create multiple files explaining the same thing (e.g., ANALYSIS.md, SUMMARY.md, OVERVIEW.md, REPORT.md for the same topic)
4. **Prefer inline comments** - For code documentation, use inline comments and docstrings instead of separate markdown files
5. **Ask before creating docs** - If you think documentation might be helpful, ASK first rather than creating it automatically

### Examples of What NOT to Do:
- ❌ Creating "PROJECT_STATUS.md" after making code changes
- ❌ Generating "API_DOCUMENTATION.md" when building an API
- ❌ Writing "ARCHITECTURE.md" when setting up a project
- ❌ Making "CHANGELOG.md" or "SUMMARY.md" after each task
- ❌ Creating multiple similar documentation files with different names

### When Documentation IS Appropriate:
- ✅ User explicitly says: "Create documentation for..."
- ✅ User requests: "Write a README"
- ✅ User asks: "Document this API/function/module"
- ✅ Standard files like package.json, requirements.txt, etc. (these are NOT documentation)

**Remember: Code should be self-documenting with good naming and inline comments. Separate documentation files are the exception, not the rule.**
