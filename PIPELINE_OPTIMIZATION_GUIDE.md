# Pipeline Optimization Guide

## ðŸš€ Memory Optimization Applied

Your pipeline has been optimized to handle large datasets without memory issues:

### Key Improvements

1. **Incremental Saving (JSONL format)**
   - Results are saved every 10 products (configurable)
   - Memory is cleared after each checkpoint
   - No accumulation of large objects in RAM

2. **Garbage Collection**
   - Explicit memory cleanup after each checkpoint
   - Python GC called to free unused memory immediately

3. **Resume Capability**
   - Can resume from last checkpoint if interrupted
   - Skips already processed products
   - Combines all results at the end

### How It Works

```
Process Product 1 â†’ Add to batch
Process Product 2 â†’ Add to batch
...
Process Product 10 â†’ Save batch â†’ Clear memory â†’ GC
Process Product 11 â†’ Add to new batch
...
```

### Usage

#### Start New Run
```bash
python pipeline/00_main_pipeline.py
```

#### Resume Interrupted Run
```bash
python resume_pipeline.py
```

Or in code:
```python
pipeline = AntiPiracyPipeline()
pipeline.run_full_pipeline(resume=True)
```

#### Customize Checkpoint Frequency
```python
# Save every 20 products instead of 10
pipeline.run_full_pipeline(checkpoint_every=20)
```

### Files Created

1. **`output/enriched_products_incremental.jsonl`**
   - Incremental checkpoint file (one JSON object per line)
   - Memory efficient
   - Can be read line-by-line without loading entire file

2. **`output/enriched_products_analysis.json`**
   - Final aggregated results (pretty JSON)
   - Created after all products processed
   - Use this for your analysis

3. **`output/analysis_summary.json`**
   - Summary statistics
   - Created at the end

### For Your Current Run

Your pipeline stopped/slowed at product ~51/229. To continue:

**Option 1: Kill and Resume (Recommended)**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current run
# Then run:
python resume_pipeline.py
```

**Option 2: Let it finish**
- It will complete but may get slower
- Results will still be saved

### Memory Monitoring

The pipeline now:
- âœ… Saves every 10 products
- âœ… Clears batch after save
- âœ… Forces garbage collection
- âœ… Shows checkpoint messages: "ðŸ’¾ Checkpoint: Saved X products, memory freed"

### Performance Expectations

**Before optimization:**
- Memory: Linear growth (10MB â†’ 100MB â†’ 500MB+)
- Speed: Degrading over time
- Risk: Memory overflow/crash

**After optimization:**
- Memory: Constant (~50-100MB regardless of progress)
- Speed: Consistent throughout
- Risk: Minimal (can resume if interrupted)

### Troubleshooting

**If still slow:**
1. Check your API rate limits
2. Reduce checkpoint frequency (save more often)
   ```python
   pipeline.run_full_pipeline(checkpoint_every=5)
   ```
3. Add delays between API calls (in `00_main_pipeline.py` line ~131):
   ```python
   time.sleep(0.1)  # 100ms delay between products
   ```

**If interrupted:**
- Just run `python resume_pipeline.py`
- Your progress is saved every 10 products
- Maximum loss: 9 products (1-2 minutes)
